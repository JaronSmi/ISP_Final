As an additional data store in our project, we implemented an rss feed. This utilizes an xml
file, and embeds various media types within it, creating a stream of said medias.
We utilized this in two ways on our project. First we did so by implementing an rss feed
for mp3 files, which hold the podcast medias in it. This xml file uses tags to show genre,
title, author, website of origin. We used another to store our blog feed as well, which
worked much the same. This process allows for us to transfer, update, and process various
medias quickly and efficiently by simply parsing through the xml file and reading the data.
We parsed this with a simple javascript in our project, but they also can be parsed by
rss feed readers if so desired.
