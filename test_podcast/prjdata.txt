We used an additonal data store structure by using an RSS feed. This is an xml file that
uses tags to encapsulate and stream various forms of media. In this case, we use it
for mp3 and text files, to store the data and easily parse and access it on command.
It tags the title, genre, content type, author, and website to access data, which is then
read by parsing and presented on the webpage likewise. It allows for easy storage, transfer
and access to large amounts of media across various platforms. The xml makes it easy for the
author to read and explain what is happening within the file, and for the user to see what
is being accessed just by looking at the file. These files can be interpreted with the use
of an rss feed reader, or in our case, by writing some javascript to read and interpret
the xml file onto the webpage for us.
